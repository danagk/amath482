This repository contains my assignment code and reports from AMATH 482: Computational Methods for Data Analysis (Winter 2020). Each assignment is in its own folder, which contains the compiled report, the LaTeX code used to write the report, and the code files used to run analysis. Data files were not uploaded because of their large size.

Contents:
* Homework 1: **Spectral Analysis for Noisy Data**. The assignment focused on transforming messy ultrasound data to track the path of a marble through a dog's intestines over time. No dogs were harmed in the making of the assignment.
* Homework 2: **Time-Frequency Analysis for Music**. For this report, I used various time-frequency analysis tools to inspect a sample of Handel's *Messiah*, and then to recover the score of two other music samples.
* Homework 3: **PCA on Systems**. In this report, I applied PCA to 4 different systems of movement, first developing a video object tracker to extract the necessary data.
* Homework 4: **Computational Modeling for Music Genre Classification**. For this assignment, I built a classification model for music samples using spectral analysis, SVD, and LDA.
* Homework 5: **Machine Learning for Image Recognition**. In this report, I describe constructing two different neural network architectures (fully connected and convolutional) for use on classifying the fashion-MNIST dataset.
